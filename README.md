# The-Alto-s-Oddysey-RD-Learning


This is my first responsive website.


* I used only CSS Vanilla (Flexbox).

* My class structure in HTML to call them from CSS may not be very descriptive, but I hope you understand this: it's my first project, so for the next one everything will be better (I think).

* The link, in case you want to see it work: https://zasbangvevo.github.io/The-Alto-s-Oddysey-RD-Learning/
